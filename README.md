# TTERMSSHBatchCreator
Just a quick C file that when compiled allows users to SSH using TeraTerm Pro without having to go through the GUI every time

Compile batchmaker.c after writing in any changes necessary (server IP for example) using a c compiler like Visual Studio's command prompt.
The exe that gets created should work to create the batch file(s) you need. 

FYI: I made this in C though I've never studied or written in it (it was the only available option on my computer at work) so there may be plenty of ways to make the code better. :)
